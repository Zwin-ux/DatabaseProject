## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out
- **Real-World Complexity:** Handles real business rules (watchlist limits, payment errors, content availability, etc.)
- **Ownership:** 90%+ authored and architected by Mazen Zwin — demonstrates full-stack database and analytics expertise
- **Performance & Reliability:** Designed for scalability, error resilience, and maintainability
- **Modern Best Practices:** Modular code, thorough documentation, and advanced SQL

## 🛠️ How to Run & Demo
1. **Database Setup:**
   - Install MySQL (or compatible RDBMS)
   - Run all scripts in `Project/Scripts/` in order: schema, business logic, functions, triggers, procedures, test data
2. **ETL & Profiling:**
   - Run Python scripts for data profiling and ETL (see `profile_data.py`, `etl_load_data.py`)
3. **Testing:**
   - Execute `Tests.sql` for automated validation of all business logic
4. **Documentation:**
   - Review ERD and requirements in `Project/Files/`
